# About Me

![Placeholder Image](https://placehold.co/200x200/eee/ccc?text=Your+Photo)
My name is Emmanuel St-Martin, and I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), advised by Prof. [Glen Berseth](https://www.glenberseth.com/).

## Research Focus

My research interests are primarily in the areas of:

* **Reinforcement Learning:** Especially interested in improving sample efficiency and generalization through techniques like model-based RL, offline RL, and representation learning.
* **Robotics:** Applying machine learning to enable robots to learn complex manipulation skills and interact intelligently with the physical world.
* **Computer Vision:** Developing perception systems that allow robots to understand their environment.

I am driven by the challenge of creating autonomous agents that can learn and adapt in real-world scenarios, moving beyond simulated environments.

## Background
