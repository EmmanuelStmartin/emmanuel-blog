# About me

Howdy, I'm Emmanuel.

I'm an engineer, AI person, statistician, economist, and moto enthusiast. I love to [code](https://www.github.com/EmmanuelStmartin) and climb absurdley large rocks. I dont know much about alot (but im working on it).


I studied CS and marketing at the [University of New Orleans](https://www.uno.edu/academics/cos/computer-science). I specialize in high-level RL software for robots. As programmer, I spend most of my time writing peices of text which solve problems. Although the problems are often caused by other pices of text, which were often also written by me.

## What I like

I tend to focus on computational topics in lots of domains, though generally I am an economist. I am currently interested in:

* Generative AI and NLP
* AI systems
* ATProtocol
* Neural network architectures
* Type systems and compilers
* Building multi-agent systems
* Asset pricing

Favorite programming languages:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fast and fun to write.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) because I think its cool.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for the love of the game.
* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) because I forget how to take derivatives.
