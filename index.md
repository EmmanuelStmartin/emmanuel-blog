# Emmanuel St-Martin

Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Mila and Université de Montréal, supervised by [Professor Glen Berseth](https://www.glenberseth.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics and Computer Vision.

I am passionate about building intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. My current work focuses on developing novel algorithms for robot learning, particularly in the areas of sample efficiency and generalization.

### About Me

I believe that the most exciting frontiers in AI involve creating agents that can interact robustly and adaptively with complex, unstructured environments. This requires tackling fundamental challenges in perception, control, and learning.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's degree, also at Mila, where I worked on [Your Master's Thesis Topic/Area]. I also have experience working as a [Your Previous Role/Industry Experience, if any].

You can find more details about my background and publications in my [CV](/assets/cv.pdf). ---
